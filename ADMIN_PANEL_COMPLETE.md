export async function isAdminRequest(req?: Request): Promise<boolean>
```

}
```

### Migration Applied

### Warnings (Non-blocking)
- Some unused imports in other components (not in admin panel)
- Can be cleaned up in future optimization pass

## Key Improvements

### User Experience
1. **No Scrolling Required**: Tabbed navigation eliminates vertical scrolling
2. **Consistent Design**: Same card style across all admin pages
3. **Better Space Utilization**: Grid layouts and responsive design
4. **Visual Hierarchy**: Gradient backgrounds for different data types
5. **Status Indicators**: Color-coded badges for quick recognition

### Performance
1. **Auto-Refresh**: Dashboard (10s), Analytics (30s)
2. **Optimized Bundles**: All pages under 5 kB before compression
3. **Efficient API Calls**: Single endpoint for dashboard data
4. **Client-Side Filtering**: Fast tab switching without API calls

### Functionality
1. **Advanced Search**: Market search across all tabs
2. **Period Selection**: Analytics with 4 time ranges
3. **Batch Operations**: User ban/unban, market resolve
4. **Audit Logging**: All admin actions tracked
5. **Real-Time Sync**: Blockchain synchronization

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Short Term
